# Evaluation-Criteria
In this section, we will discuss common methods for evaluating segmentation model 

The segmentation quality evaluation is very vital for image processing, particularly in security cases, including autonomous vehicles.
There are many evaluation criteria developed for segmentation evaluation so that researchers can make a choice based on their needs. 
It’s worth noting that there isn’t any collectively consented technique to make this choice [1][2].
It should be remembered that the task of semantic segmentation is simply to predict the class of each pixel in an image and the predicted output’s shape matches the input shape in terms of width, height, and depth.

##  The most well-known and common criteria used by researchers are:

1.  Jaccard similarity: deduced from the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. This criterion is employed to quantify the overlap between the predicted output and ground truth. For example, by taking into account the ground truth, the IoU score of the following prediction can be calculated as follows.

  The IoU metric is calculated by dividing the number of the pixels common between the ground truth (A) and 
  predicted output (B) by the total number of pixels present across both.

  The term A∩B implies the pixels belonging to both the ground truth (A) and prediction (B) areas are shown while the term A∪B implies all the pixels present in each of these areas. Finally, given that each class has it's our IoU score, a global mean IoU score is obtained by averaging all classes’ IoU scores.
